# ESP Blood Pressure Monitor Hack
I hacked a Sanitas SBM 21 to get the blood pressure data out of it and do repeated and timed measurements. 

## Goal
I am fed up with pricey monitors, old software, proprietary apps or missing features.  
Rechargeable battery would be great too. Maybe even a quieter way of pumping up the cuff.  
Heck, even using other sensors to track motion, oxygen and pulse.  

## Initial thoughts
Prototype will use an ESP32 to read out the LCD pins on the commercial, accurate BP monitor, trigger button presses, and so on.  
A Wi-Fi hotspot will be created on demand for firmware updates and simple data gathering.  
An app connected over BLE serial for power saving would be a great addition in the future.  

# Warning
I just started this project; it is not working at all at the moment. Please be patient!
